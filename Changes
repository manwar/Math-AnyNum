        [FIXES]

        - Fixes a rounding error in ilog(n,b) when n is very large or when n is not a power of b.

        [IMPROVEMENTS]

        - Minor optimization in `numify()` for integers and rationals.
        - Added checks for exact divisibility of two integers.
        - Optimized the gcd() and lcm() functions when the second argument is a native integer.
        - Documentation improvements.

        [FIXES]

        - Fixed the creation of very large constant integers in `:overload` mode.

        [ADDITIONS]

        - Added the `nude(x)` function.
        - Added the `conj(x)` function.
        - Added the `norm(x)` function.
        - Added the `reals(x)` function.
        - Added the `as_dec(x,y)` function.

        [IMPROVEMENTS]

        - Extended the `agm()` function to support complex numbers.
        - Extended the `as_frac()` function to accept an optional base.
        - Functions `inv(x)` and `neg(x)` are exportable.
        - Math::AnyNum->new() is considerably faster.
        - Many internal simplifications and optimizations.

        [FIXES]

        - Fixed a typo in `is_inf()` and `is_ninf()`.

0.05    2017-04-09

        [FIXES]

        - Fixed the (in)equality checks when one of the operands is NaN.
        - Comparing anything to NaN, now returns `undef` instead of `0`.

        [IMPROVEMENTS]

        - Refactored the method `is_power` to handle scalar arguments more efficiently.
        - Optimized the `root` and `iroot` method when the second argument is a scalar.

        [FIXES]

        - Fixed some tests under GMP < 5.1.0 (thanks to Slaven Rezić; https://github.com/trizen/Math-AnyNum/issues/1).
        - Workaround in log10() with MPC < 1.0 (thanks to Slaven Rezić; https://github.com/trizen/Math-AnyNum/issues/1).
